a. Half-Page Summary
The Task Management Dashboard is a simple Kanban-style task board that allows users 
to view, add, and move tasks between different columns (To Do, In Progress, Done). The 
tasks are persisted using API calls to a mock REST API, which is set up locally using 
json-server. The project is built with ReactJS for the front-end, axios for API 
requests, and Tailwind CSS for styling. It meets the core functionality of a Kanban 
board, including the ability to drag and drop tasks and add new tasks with details 
such as title, description, and status.

Overall, the project is functional and allows users to easily manage tasks. It 
provides a clean user interface and offers essential features required for a task
 management system. However, there are areas for improvement, particularly around
 error handling, task deletion, and drag-and-drop interactions.



b. Self-Criticism
Upon reviewing the project, there are a few shortcomings I noticed:

=> Lack of Error Handling: While the API calls work as expected, I did not implement
 error handling. This means that if the API server is down or if there’s a network
 issue, the user won’t be informed of the failure. A better user experience could be 
 achieved by showing an error message when an API request fails.

=> Task Deletion: I did not implement the functionality to delete tasks. Although this 
feature is not strictly necessary for the core functionality, it would make the 
application more complete by offering full CRUD operations.

=> Performance Optimization: As the number of tasks grows, performance could degrade. 
Currently, all tasks are rendered at once. If there were a large number of tasks, 
this could lead to performance issues. Implementing techniques like virtualization 
or lazy loading could help mitigate this.

=> Limited Visual Design: While the layout is functional, the visual design could be 
enhanced. There’s room for more polished UI elements like hover effects, animations, 
and a better color scheme to improve the user experience.

=> Drag-and-Drop Feedback: Although the drag-and-drop feature is functional, it lacks 
visual feedback. It would be better to show the user where the task will be placed 
and provide smoother animations when tasks are moved.



c. Improvements
If I had more time, the following improvements would be made:

1. Task Deletion:
Add the ability to delete tasks. This feature would be particularly useful for users 
who no longer need a task on their board.

2. Error Handling and Notifications:
Implement error handling for API calls and provide user feedback in case of failures 
(e.g., network errors, failed API requests). This could be done with error banners or modal dialogs.

3. Drag-and-Drop Enhancements:
Enhance the drag-and-drop experience by showing where a task will drop and adding 
smooth animations when tasks are moved. This would improve the overall user 
experience.

4. Task Editing:
Allow users to click on a task and edit its title, description, or status. This would
 make the application more interactive and functional for task management.

5. Authentication:
If more time were available, I would implement user authentication (e.g., with 
Firebase or JWT). This would allow users to log in, create their own boards, and 
manage tasks independently.

6. Styling and Responsiveness:
Enhance the overall UI by improving typography, colors, and responsiveness. Adding 
responsive layouts for different screen sizes would ensure the app looks good on 
mobile devices as well.



d. Technology Rating
- ReactJS: 9/10
I’m quite comfortable with ReactJS, and I used it to create the core components and 
manage the application’s state effectively. However, I could have further optimized 
state management (e.g., using useReducer instead of useState for complex states) and 
improved performance for larger datasets.

- Tailwind CSS: 7/10
Tailwind made it easy to style the application quickly, but the styling could have 
been more polished. I used basic Tailwind classes, but I could have customized the 
design more to make it visually appealing and consistent.

- axios: 8/10
axios worked well for handling the API requests. I used it with async/await syntax, 
making the code readable. However, I did not include error handling, which would have 
made it more robust.

- Drag-and-Drop (HTML5 Drag API): 7/10
The drag-and-drop functionality works, but it lacks advanced features like visual 
feedback or smooth animations. A library like react-dnd or react-beautiful-dnd could 
improve this.


Conclusion
The project demonstrates the basic functionality of a task management system using 
React, axios, and Tailwind CSS. While it meets the core requirements, there are 
areas for improvement, such as error handling, task deletion, and a more polished 
UI. The drag-and-drop functionality is basic but functional. I would rate the overall 
experience of building this project as a positive one, with several opportunities for 
further enhancement.
